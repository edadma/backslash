Overview
========

Backslash is a string templating language written in Scala. Backslash looks like TeX with the default delimiters (which can be changed), but it's not TeX. Backslash behaves like any other macro/templating language: it copies input text to output. Backslash is an attempt to create a dryer templating language that still allows you to copy HTML (or whatever you're using it for) verbatim. So, although Backslash is somewhat inspired by TeX, it shares very little in common with it except less typing. If your HTML doesn't containing any scripting then the "TeXish" delimiters (`\`, `{`, `}`) are usually fine. However, as in [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/), delimiters can be changed anywhere in the input stream (except between command arguments).


Example
=======

Here's a typical Backslash template with looping and conditionals.

### Template

```html
<h3>Products</h3>

<ul>
  \for products {
    <li>\name&emsp;$\price&emsp;
      \if inStock {
        <a href="#">Buy It!</a>
      } \else {
        Out of stock.
      }
    </li>
  }
</ul>
```

### Data

```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "RCA 32\u2033 ROKU SMART TV",
      "price": 207.00,
      "inStock": true
    },
    {
      "name": "LG 55UK6300",
      "price": 1098.00,
      "inStock": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output

```html
<h3>Products</h3>

<ul>

    <li>RCA 32â€³ ROKU SMART TV&emsp; $207.00&emsp;

        <a href="#">Buy It!</a>

    </li>

    <li>LG 55UK6300&emsp; $1098.00&emsp;

        Out of stock.

    </li>

</ul>
```


Syntax
======

Being a macro/templating language, Backslash basically copies input to output, while performing the appropriate character decoding and encoding, respectively. The basic character copying behaviour is *escaped* or interrupted when one of three *delimiters* or special separator character sequences is encountered, namely: the *control sequence* escape, the beginning of a *group*, and the end of a *group*.


Control Sequences
-----------------

A *control sequence* is a way of interrupting the normal character copying behaviour in order to tell Backslash to do something else at that point in the input stream. Once the action indicated by the control sequence is complete, character copying resumes with the characters immediately following the control sequence, skipping over any which space right after the name of the control sequence.  Control sequences begin with a `\` (backslash) character (whence the name of this language) followed by the name of the control sequence.

There are five categories into which control sequences can be grouped, depending on how they need to be handled during *parsing* and also during *rendering*. *Parsing* refers to how input stream characters are treated, and *rendering* refers to how the output stream is produced.  The five categories are discussed below.

### Regular Commands

*Regular commands* or *functions* constitute the largest category of control sequences and cover a wide range of uses.  They are called *regular* because they are all handled the same way during parsing and rendering.  Some functions need to be supplied with special input, known as *arguments* (see [Regular Arguments](./#regular-arguments)) in order to produce an output, and others can produce their output without requiring any arguments.  The [Regular Command Reference](./regular-command-reference.html) contains information on all the built-in regular commands.

Here are some examples.

#### Without Arguments

Here is an example of a regular command that doesn't take any arguments:

    The current time is \now.

which outputs

    The current time is 2018-05-31T19:39:03.489-04:00[America/Montreal].

The `.` following the `\now` control sequence just gets copied to the output.


#### With Arguments

Next is an example of a regular command that takes an argument that is a string of characters and transforms it into another string of characters:

    \markdown {this is a __boring__ *example*}

which outputs

    <p>this is a <strong>boring</strong> <em>example</em></p>

Not all commands take character string arguments.  Here's an example of a command that takes two numerical arguments:

    three plus four is \+ 3 4

which outputs

    three plus four is 7
